**Postmortem Report: Service Outage on Web Stack**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** August 22, 2024, 15:00 - 17:00 UTC
- **Impact:** The outage caused the web application to be completely down for all users. Approximately 100% of users were affected, as they could not access the application or perform any actions.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfiguration in the load balancer’s SSL/TLS settings led to a failure in handling secure connections, causing the application to be inaccessible.

**Timeline:**
- **15:00 UTC:** The outage began. Users started reporting that they could not access the application.
- **15:05 UTC:** Monitoring systems triggered an alert indicating a high rate of failed connection attempts.
- **15:10 UTC:** An engineer noticed the issue via user complaints and internal monitoring alerts.
- **15:15 UTC:** Initial investigation focused on the application server logs, suspecting a possible issue with server health.
- **15:30 UTC:** The investigation was redirected to the load balancer configuration after noticing SSL/TLS handshake failures in the logs.
- **15:45 UTC:** The incident was escalated to the DevOps team responsible for load balancer configuration.
- **16:00 UTC:** The DevOps team identified that the SSL/TLS settings had been incorrectly updated during a recent configuration change.
- **16:15 UTC:** The SSL/TLS settings were reverted to their previous state, and the load balancer was reconfigured.
- **16:30 UTC:** Services were restored, and the application became accessible again.
- **17:00 UTC:** Monitoring confirmed that the issue was resolved and that normal operations had resumed.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Cause:** The load balancer’s SSL/TLS settings were misconfigured during a routine update. The incorrect settings caused SSL/TLS handshake failures, preventing secure connections from being established between users and the web application.
- **Resolution:** The DevOps team reverted the load balancer configuration to the previous, correct SSL/TLS settings. This action restored secure connections and resolved the outage. Verification steps confirmed that the application was now accessible to all users.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements:**
  - Enhance the process for validating configuration changes to prevent similar issues in the future.
  - Implement more rigorous testing procedures for SSL/TLS settings in a staging environment before applying changes to production.
- **Tasks:**
  1. **Review and update the change management process** for configuration updates, including additional validation steps.
  2. **Develop and implement a comprehensive testing protocol** for SSL/TLS configurations in a staging environment.
  3. **Enhance monitoring and alerting systems** to detect SSL/TLS issues more quickly and accurately.
  4. **Conduct training sessions** for the DevOps team on best practices for configuration changes and SSL/TLS settings.
  5. **Document the incident and resolution steps** thoroughly to improve the incident response plan and ensure knowledge sharing within the team.

This postmortem outlines the steps taken to identify and resolve the issue and provides a roadmap for preventing similar incidents in the future.
